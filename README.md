# Artist-Portfolio

This project was built to test my implementation of the following:

- How to implement the box model(margin, padding and borders) to structure HTML elements
- How to group elements using containers.
- How to use different CSS Selectors to target the elements successfully.
- How to style text and links to enhance the appearance of the project
- How to employ semantic HTML elements to create meaningful and accessible web content.
